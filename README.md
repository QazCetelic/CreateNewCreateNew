### Easily and quikly create new entries into the "Create New" file menu in Linux desktops.

### How it works
The .template-files contains template files and should be placed at "/home/qaz/.local/share/templates/" (so that makes /home/qaz/.local/share/templates/template-files), the script.py file generates .desktop files that add options to the "Create New" menu. New files can be added to the .template-files folder and new entries can be added to the bottom of the script.py file.

### Default templates included
